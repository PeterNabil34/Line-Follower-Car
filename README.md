A Car senses the black line by using IR Sensors and then sends the signal to Arduino. Then the Arduino drives the motor according to sensors' output. They are three IR sensor modules namely left sensor, right sensor and middle sensor. Each one responsible for a direction. Using Printed Circuit Board (PCB) and Arduino UNO.
