# Line-Follower-Car (Using Printed Circuit Board (PCB) and Arduino UNO)
A car senses the black line by using IR Sensors and sends the signal to the Arduino. Then the Arduino drives the motor according to sensors' output. They are three IR sensor modules namely left sensor, right sensor and middle sensor. Each one is responsible for a direction.
